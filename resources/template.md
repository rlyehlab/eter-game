# A SAMPLE GAME DESIGN TEMPLATE

Here are the elements of a game design document. The idea is that, by completing the game design document, the team can better envision the game.


|Template Element|Example|
|----------------|------|
|Overview of Concept|The concept is to create a web-based single-player online game for pharmaceutical sales representatives that provide engaging, relevant, and personalized learning on the topic of opening and closing a conversation with a physician. Topics covered in the game are tied to our ABC engagement model. The game is based on a realistic setting of a physician’s office. The game will happen from a third-person perspective, and the learner will be evaluated on credibility, affability, and the ability to become an information source for the physician.|
|Outcome|Pharmaceutical sales representatives will properly use the ABC model to gain more time with the physician and become valuable resources to the physician.|
|Instructional Objectives|At the end of the game, the  learners will be able to: i) Properly apply the three steps of an ABC opening, ii) Properly apply the two steps of the ABC closing iii) Appropriately prepare for a call on a physician - Affective - Behave in a warm, friendly, professional manner toward the physician
|Description of Character(s)|The learners will be able to customize an avatar in terms of eyes, skin, and hair and be able to select different styles of clothing. The learners will interact with six NPCs, three female and three male, each representing ethnic and personality diversity. The NPC physicians will each have different amounts of time they are able to spend with the sales representative|
|Environment| Home office for the learner and then six different offices; the learners will walk their characters to a car that has a map on the passenger’s seat. The map has images, each representing a different physician’s office location. Learners will click on the map to arrive at the front door of that location. Six physician offices need to be created. Office 1: Rural small family practice. Older filing cabinets, small waiting room space with six chairs. Office 2: . . .
|Description of Gameplay|Upon entering the learning management system and launching the game, the learner is placed into an office where customization can occur. After the learner customizes his or her avatar, an audio sounds of a phone ringing. Learners must click on the phone to answer it. At that time, a voice provides instructions on how to navigate through the game. At the end of the call, instructions are given as to the next step. When the call is over, learners must click on the computer to view a list of physicians. Each image and name is clickable to receive more information. The learners must then prioritize the list to decide in what order to visit the physicians. Next . . .
|Reward Structure|The points in this game are based on three variables: credibility, affability, and the ability to become an information source for the physician. Each is scored separately and then an overall score is provided, the “Engagement Score.” Within the game, the focus is on a mastery orientation toward the goal. This means each learner works to master the content in the game and overall score is not related to any other learner’s scores. Feedback is provided immediately with an unobtrusive pop-up accompanied by a longer explanation available after play.
|Look and Feel of Game|The goal is to provide a realistic-looking avatar in three dimensions. The player will be able to see both the front and back of his or her avatar through a spinning function. The environment will contain 3-D objects that are typical colors, such as a black phone, gray computer terminal, or brown briefcase. The heads-up display will contain six elements. The first is . . .
|Technical Description|This game will be developed using Caspian’s ThinkingWorlds software to provide the 3-D environment. The game will be accessed via the corporate intranet and will not require any client downloads. The results need to flow into our learning management system when the player completes the game in a compatible format. Additionally . . .
|Timeline|This can be a Gantt chart or other method of showing the estimated time to complete the project.
